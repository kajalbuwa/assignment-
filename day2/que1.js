// array

const clothes=['jacket','t-shirt'];

console.log(clothes[0]);

//  output :
//  undefined

// here value of clothes[0] is jacket 
// but in 2nd line we give length of clothes array = 0 but lenth of an array starts from 1 
// and index of an array starts from 0.
// that is why error occurswhen we print clothes[0] it shows output undefined.
